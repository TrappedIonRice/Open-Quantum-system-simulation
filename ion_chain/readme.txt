package: ion_chain
Installation:
copy the file ion_chain to C:\users\"your username"\.ipython
Functions:
sub-package opeartor: 
operator\spin: generate spin operators acting on the N ion spin space
operator\phonon: generate phonon operators acting on the N ion phonon space
sub-package ising:
ising\ising_ps: Compute basic physical quantities of ising coupling system and generate the 
Hamiltonian under pure spin approximation
ising\ising_c:Compute the complete Hamiltonian for the ising coupling system

use list_func() to see the documentations of each package, for instance, use spin.list_func()
to see documentations for subpackage operator\spin
